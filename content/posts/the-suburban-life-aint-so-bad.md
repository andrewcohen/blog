I used to dream that after college I'd move out to California to live some kind of "modernista" lifestyle. Surfing. Beaches. Sunglasses. Perfect weather - every day. How could you not be happy if you had all that?

It's been nearly 2 months since the COVID-19 social distancing lockdown began. Living in New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak, has been enlightening to say the least.
Sure, my feelings have changed as I get older, but I never realized how ungrateful i'd been until now.

Things I didn't realize I was grateful for:

- breathing the air without a mask on
- walking out the front door straight into the world
- visiting family for a day or even a few hours.

A week ago, Elana and I came out to the suburbs for a change of pace. Our first weekend was a joy. Sat outside most of the day. I tried to read a book but fell asleep instead. The sun wrapped me in a blanket of warmth and a layer of sunburn. As the sun began to set, we took a nice long walk - mask free - with other people 6+ feet away.

The things I disliked about the suburbs -- the things I could no longer do -- were actually simple comforts to me. Walking down a quiet street. Watching the wind move the clouds and blow through the trees. Breathing a zone of air that is yours and only yours, even if it's only for a moment.

I asked Elana if sitting around the house and relaxing outside was doing nothing. She said "bringing food outside is an activity for the day". Is it difficult? No. Is it complicated? Not at all. Does it make me happy and fulfilled? Absolutely. It may not be my "California Dream," but I'm happier in my own backyard.
