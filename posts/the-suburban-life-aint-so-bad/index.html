Surfing. Beaches. Sunglasses. Perfect weather - every day. How could you not be happy if you had all that?</p><p>It&rsquo;s been nearly 2 months since the COVID-19 social distancing lockdown began. Living in New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak, has been enlightening to say the least.
Sure, my feelings have changed as I get older, but I never realized how ungrateful i&rsquo;d been until now.</p><p>Things I didn&rsquo;t realize I was grateful for:</p><ul><li>breathing the air without a mask on</li><li>walking out the front door straight into the world</li><li>visiting family for a day or even a few hours.</li></ul><p>A week ago, Elana and I came out to the suburbs for a change of pace. Our first weekend was a joy. Sat outside most of the day. I tried to read a book but fell asleep instead. The sun wrapped me in a blanket of warmth and a layer of sunburn. As the sun began to set, we took a nice long walk - mask free - with other people 6+ feet away.</p><p>The things I disliked about the suburbs &ndash; the things I could no longer do &ndash; were actually simple comforts to me. Walking down a quiet street. Watching the wind move the clouds and blow through the trees. Breathing a zone of air that is yours and only yours, even if it&rsquo;s only for a moment.</p><p>I asked Elana if sitting around the house and relaxing outside was doing nothing. She said &ldquo;bringing food outside is an activity for the day&rdquo;. Is it difficult? No. Is it complicated? Not at all. Does it make me happy and fulfilled? Absolutely. It may not be my &ldquo;California Dream,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m happier in my own backyard.</p></p></div><div class=page-footer></div></div><footer class=footer-mobile><div class=social-icons></div><div class=footer-mobile-links><p><a href=https://github.com/kimcc/hugo-theme-noteworthy target=_blank rel=noopener>Noteworthy theme</a></p><span class=divider-bar>|</span><p><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Built with Hugo</a></p></div><script src=http://example.org/js/main.min.fa5c2b23e07b5d9bfad267a52b4b24fdb053e6fb7524993383594926a3ac270c.js integrity="sha256-+lwrI+B7XZv60melK0sk/bBT5vt1JJkzg1lJJqOsJww=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></footer></body></html>
